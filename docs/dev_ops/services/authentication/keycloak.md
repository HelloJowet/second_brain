# üóù Keycloak

## Docker compose

### Resolve local naming

Sometimes Keycloak is accessed via multiple routes. For example `host.docker.internal` (from a backend) and `localhost` (from a frontend). To ensure consistent access, an additional hostname is introduced that works for both.

Add the following entry to your `/etc/hosts` file to resolve `keycloak.internal` to your local machine:

```sh
echo -e '127.0.0.1\tkeycloak.internal' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

Verify the setup by running:

```sh
ping keycloak.internal
```

This resolves `keycloak.internal` to `127.0.0.1` for both backend and frontend access.
